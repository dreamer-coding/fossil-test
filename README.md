# ***Fossil Test by Fossil Logic***

**Fossil Test** is a comprehensive unit testing, mocking, and benchmarking suite created by Fossil Logic, designed to ensure the reliability and performance of C and C++ projects. With support for multiple development methodologies, including Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD), Fossil Test provides a versatile foundation for crafting high-quality test cases across various workflows.

The Fossil suite consists of three complementary frameworks to streamline the development and testing process:

- **Fossil Test**: The core unit testing framework that enables developers to create, manage, and execute unit tests effectively, ensuring each component functions as expected.
- **Fossil Mock**: A dedicated mocking library that simulates complex dependencies. Using mock objects, developers can isolate and thoroughly test individual components, improving the precision and reliability of test coverage.
- **Fossil Mark**: A benchmarking tool that provides detailed performance insights by measuring execution time, identifying bottlenecks, and offering in-depth reporting to optimize code efficiency.

Together, **Fossil Test**, **Fossil Mock**, and **Fossil Mark** offer a powerful, integrated toolkit for developing, testing, and optimizing robust software, making them an essential asset for developers committed to quality and performance.

## ***Prerequisites***

To get started with Fossil Test, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: Fossil Test requires Meson. If you donâ€™t have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

---

### Adding Fossil Test Dependency

To integrate Fossil Test into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Meson Build System**:
   Install Meson version `1.3` or newer:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # To install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # To upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Create a `.wrap` File**:
   Add the `fossil-test.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test.git
   revision = v1.1.4

   [provide]
   fossil-test = fossil_test_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**:
   In your `meson.build` file, integrate Fossil Test by adding the following line:
   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-test')
   ```

   **Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest release of Fossil Test. Visit the [Fossil Test Releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test/releases) page for the latest versions.
