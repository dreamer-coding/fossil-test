## ***Prerequisites***

To get started with Fossil Test, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you donâ€™t have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

---

### Adding Fossil Test Dependency

#### Adding Fossil Test Dependency With Meson

1. **Install Meson Build System**:
   Install Meson version `1.3` or newer:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # To install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # To upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Create a `.wrap` File**:
   Add the `fossil-test.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test.git
   revision = v1.2.0

   [provide]
   fossil-test = fossil_test_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**:
   In your `meson.build` file, integrate Fossil Test by adding the following line:
   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-test')
   ```
