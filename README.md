> **Note:** In addition to the `--help` option, Pizza Test CLI supports `--help` and subcommand-specific help commands. You can use `<command> --help` (e.g., `run --help`) to display detailed usage information for any command or subcommand. This provides flexible ways to access documentation directly from the terminal.

## ***Prerequisites***

To get started with Pizza Test, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you don‚Äôt have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).
- **Conan Package Manager**: If you prefer using Conan, ensure it is installed by following the instructions on the official [Conan website](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html).

---

### Adding Dependency

#### Adding via Meson Git Wrap

To add a git-wrap, place a `.wrap` file in `subprojects` with the Git repo URL and revision, then use dependency('fossil-test') in meson.build so Meson can fetch and build it automatically.

#### Adding via Conan GitHub repository

Conan can install packages directly from a GitHub repository if it contains a valid conanfile.py.

```bash
conan install git+https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test.git#v1.2.8 --name pizza_test --build=missing
```

#### Integrate the Dependency:

Add the `fossil-test.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

```ini
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test.git
revision = v1.2.8

[provide]
dependency_names = fossil-test, pizza-test
```

In your `meson.build` file, integrate Fossil Test by adding the following line:

```meson
dep = dependency('fossil-test')
```

**Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest release of Pizza Test. Visit the [Pizza Test Releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test/releases) page for the latest versions.

## Configure Build Options

To configure the build system with testing enabled, use the following command:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

#### Tests Double as Samples

The `fossil-test` project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to write tests with `fossil-test`.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to build Meson.  
In the same way, `fossil-test` validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
