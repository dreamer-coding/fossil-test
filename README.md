# ***Fossil Test: Unit Testing/Mocking Framework*** - `C, C++`

**Overview:**
Fossil Test is a robust unit testing and mocking framework developed by Fossil Logic. It is designed to facilitate the creation of high-quality test cases for C and C++ projects, promoting software reliability and correctness. The framework supports various development methodologies, including Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD), offering flexibility for diverse development workflows.

In addition to Fossil Test, Fossil Logic also offers two additional frameworks to enhance your development experience:
- **Fossil Mark**: A powerful benchmarking tool that allows developers to measure code performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize execution time. It offers detailed timing information and reporting.
- **Fossil Mock**: A mocking library enabling developers to simulate the behavior of complex dependencies. By using mock objects, you can write focused unit tests that test isolated components, enhancing test reliability and coverage.

Together, Fossil Test, Fossil Mark, and Fossil Mock provide a comprehensive toolkit for developing, testing, and optimizing high-quality software.

## ***Prerequisites***

To get started with Fossil Test, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: Fossil Test requires Meson. If you donâ€™t have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

---

### Adding Fossil Test Dependency

To integrate Fossil Test into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Meson Build System**:
   Install Meson version `1.3` or newer:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # To install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # To upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Create a `.wrap` File**:
   Add the `fossil-test.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test.git
   revision = v1.0.7

   [provide]
   fossil-test = fossil_test_dep
   fossil-mock = fossil_mock_dep
   fossil-mark = fossil_mark_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**:
   In your `meson.build` file, integrate Fossil Test by adding the following line:
   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-test')
   ```

   **Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest release of Fossil Test. Visit the [Fossil Test Releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-test/releases) page for the latest versions.
